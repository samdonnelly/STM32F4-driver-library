# STM32F4 Driver Library

Drivers for the STM32F4 written using a NUCLEO-F411RE development board. This library contains drivers for devices, protocols, hardware features and general software tools that can be applied to any application written on the same platform. The library is written primarily in C to provide compatibility with both C and C++ applications, however some software tools are wittne in C++. Drivers are continuously added and improved upon as needed. 

## Drivers 

Drivers are written for three main categories: devices, peripherals and tools. Devices are external hardware that interface with the controller. Peripherals is a blanket term referring to protocols and hardware features (such as I2C and interrupts) used for handling communication and signal processing. And lastly, tools are general software tasks that can be used by any application that needs it.

## Generated Code 

This library is built upon baseline code generated by STM32CubeMX for the STM32F4. It includes the definition of register addresses, data types for specific hardware features, and setup of clock speeds. This code is kept in the folder linked below.
