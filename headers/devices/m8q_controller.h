 *          compatible with the non-blocking delay function. 
 *

 *          occurred in the driver and controller. 
 *          
 *          The state of the controller can be changed using the flag setting functions. 
 *          This function should be called continuously to make sure the controller can 
 *          update it's state and keep operating the driver. The controller 
 *          initialization function must be called before starting to use this.

 *          initialization function the controller will default to the read state from 
 *          the init state without needing to set this flag. In the read state the

 *          state will read as the idle state, the only difference being the low power 
 *          flag will be set which can be read using the getter. The reason for this 
 *          is that low power mode and idle mode both perform no action. 
 *          
 *          Setting the low power flag will cause the driver to set the device 
 *          interrupt pin low. When the device is in low power mode it doesn't send 
 *          data and it consumes small amounts of power.

 *          state which gives the device time to wake up and restart its data stream.
